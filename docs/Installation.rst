Installation
============

The most convenient and fastest way to install a package is to directly download the library from the Python package catalog (Python Package Index, PyPI).
The version of the source files in the directory is up-to-date and consistent with the GitHub repository::

    pip install survivors

----------

An alternative installation method is based on the use of source files.
The first step is to download the source files using Github::

    git clone command https://github.com/iuliivasilev/dev-survivors.git

Or getting and unpacking the archive of
`the latest published version <https://github.com/iuliivasilev/dev-survivors/releases/>`_.
Next, use the command line to go to the **dev-survivors** directory.
Finally, the manual installation of the library is completed after executing the following command::

    python command setup.py install
